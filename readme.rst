Accessible Output 2: Make your app speak
==================================================

Accessible Output 2 is an MIT licensed library for speaking and brailling through multiple screen readers and other accessibility systems.

Accessible Output 2 makes selection of the appropriate speech and Braille output a snap, and also allows the programmer to select and use a specific output, for instance to force speaking through the Microsoft Speech API even if the user has a screen reader loaded.

.. code-block:: python

>>> import accessible_output2.outputs.auto
    >>> o = accessible_output2.outputs.auto.Auto()
    >>> o.output("Some text") #attempts to both speak and braille the given text through the first available output
    >>> o.speak("Some other text", interrupt=True) #Speak some text through the output, without brailling it, and interrupt the currently-speaking text if any

Accessible Output 2 makes it simple to add spoken and brailled notifications to your applications on multiple platforms, facilitating accessibility for the visually impaired and also providing a nice alternative means of providing notifications to a sighted user.
